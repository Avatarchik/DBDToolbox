# DeadBySounds
A sound extractor for Dead by Daylight

### How
Use it that way:
```sh
DeadBySounds.exe [Path to the game]
```
*By default, [Path to the game] is equal to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight"*

### When it's done
You can found all the sounds in the "output" directory.
The unnamed ones (whether it's a duplicate or the soft can't figure out the name) will be randomly named and placed at the root of this folder
